# Reproducing Experiment Results

To accurately replicate the experiment results, please follow these steps:

1. **Organize Image Folders**:
   - Relocate all folders from the "qa_pair_images" directory to the "Experiments" folder. This ensures that all image paths are correctly set up.

2. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Update the configuration files with your Bard and OpenAI API keys. Replace the existing placeholders in the configuration files with your valid API keys.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Some Python packages are required for the experiment. Install them using pip:
     ```
     pip install bardapi bert_score rouge openai
     ```
   - Ensure these packages are installed in your Python environment before running the experiment scripts.

By following these steps, you should be able to recreate the experiment environment and reproduce the results as documented.
